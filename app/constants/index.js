      "Went to go have a look at an Audi A1 with my husband and father-in-law. Car was in great condition, great price, and the service we were given was outstanding. Very polite & helpful - to the point my father-in-law didn't come with the intention of buying a new car but we went away with 2! Highly recommend - couldn't do enough for us! Had the cars around 7 months and so far so good; no problems whatsoever!",

    name: "Tom Betts",
    feedback: `Highly recommend. I purchased a BMW 320D. It was well presented, came fully serviced and valeted. The car also came with a 3-months warranty and just under 3 months I came across a fault that was taken care of with a local garage. Paid with no hassle by Ace Motor Sales. Would definitely buy from them again. üëçüèª`,
